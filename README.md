# Tribute-Page
Tribute Page - Free Code Camp Project

The page is a tribute to Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and contains an image and some text (from wikipedia).
The page was made as a project as part of the Free Code Camp course on Responsive Web Design.  It uses html and css and passes the following tests:

#Tribute Page tests

#Content

*1. My tribute page should have an element with corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
*2. I should see an element with corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
*3. I should see either a <figure> or <div> element with corresponding id="img-div".
* 4. Within the "img-div" element, I should see an <img> element with a corresponding id="image".
*5. Within the "img-div" element, I should see either a <figcaption> or <div> element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in "img-div".
*6. I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
*7. I should see an <a> element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to "_blank" in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

#Layout
*1. The <img> element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
*2. The <img> element should be centered within its parent element.
